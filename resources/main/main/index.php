          <p>SJR 68 makes it easier for consumers to find brands and products they enjoy, whether it’s your favorite
            brand name domestic beer, craft beer wine, or spirits from anywhere in the world.

          <p>
            This legislation is a boon for Oklahoma craft brewers, who will now have an opportunity to open tasting
            rooms with full-strength beer and brew pubs. It will also create jobs by providing a market for additional
            beer/wine/spirit distributorships. Unlike other modernization proposals, it creates minimal disruption in
            the market while eliminating outdated regulations that hurt Oklahoma businesses.

          <h3>Now or Never: A Solution That Will Win
          </h3>

          <p>
            If the Legislature Oklahoma House of Representatives fails to pass SJR 68, or allows special interest groups
            to add poison-pill amendments, the state will be faced with competing and confusing initiative petitions.
            SJR 68, as written today, is the best chance for successful alcohol modernization the state has seen in
            decades.

          <h3>Responsible and Written to Protect Public Safety </h3>

          <p>
            Modernizing regulations on alcohol doesn’t mean eliminating safeguards that protect the public. SJR 68
            maintains an effective-state based regulatory system

          <h3>New Opportunities for Locally Owned Businesses </h3>

          <p>
            Locally owned liquor stores throughout the state would be allowed to sell cold, refrigerated beer and wine. Additionally, they will be able to sell non-alcoholic items like ice, juice and soda, allowing them to better serve their customers and offer a wider selection of products.

                No. SJR 68 will make alcoholic beverages less expensive by streamlining the process by which they get to
                market and creating more competition within the marketplace.

                SJR 68 will increase the availability of certain brands of alcoholic beverages that are not currently in

                No. Every licensing state – which represent the vast majority of states in this country – uses the
