                This legislation is a boon for Oklahoma craft brewers, who will now have an opportunity to open tasting
                rooms with full-strength beer and brew pubs. It will also create jobs by providing a market for
                additional

                in
                the market while eliminating outdated regulations that hurt Oklahoma businesses.

              </h3>

              <p>
                If the Oklahoma House of Representatives fails to pass SJR 68, or allows special interest groups
                to add poison-pill amendments, the state will be faced with competing and confusing initiative
                petitions.
                SJR 68, as written today, is the best chance for successful alcohol modernization the state has seen in
                decades.

              <p>
                Modernizing regulations on alcohol doesn’t mean eliminating safeguards that protect the public. SJR 68
                maintains an effective-state based regulatory system.

                Locally owned liquor stores throughout the state would be allowed to sell cold beer and wine.
                Additionally, they will be able to sell non-alcoholic items like ice, juice and soda, allowing them to
                better serve their customers and offer a wider selection of products.

                Some believe the ORA is protecting the commissions of two wine brokers who serve on its board of
                directors. By eliminating the requirement that wineries sell to every distributor, SJR 68 also
                eliminates a provision mandating that wineries use brokers.

                No. SJR 68 will likely make most alcoholic beverages less expensive by streamlining the process by which
                they get to
                market and creating more competition within the marketplace.

                No. Every licensing state – which represent the vast majority of states in the U.S. – uses the

                wholesalers and
                brokers.
